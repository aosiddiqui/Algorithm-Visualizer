# Algorithm-Visualizer
* The objective of this project was to help those who are starting out learning about DSA (sorting algorithms especially) to visualize the algorithms to get an insight into how they actually work.
* The whole project is made using Python3 and the UI is built using Tkinter (Python's built-in UI package).
* The sorting algorithms covered are: bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort for now.
